                                I can simply describe myself as someone who likes to explore. Therefore,
                                I spent most of my time doing researches about things that invoke my
                                interest. On top of that I like implementing what I learn through the 
                                researches to have a better undestanding. Lastly I am tech enthusiast.

                                    My fascination has always been in engineering. 
                                    I grew up enjoying seeing what engineers are capable of, thus, 
                                    it has always been my wish to be in the engineering field.

                                is because all the tools that are required are easy accessible and cost free. 
                                As someone who love coding it becomes much more interesting 
                                when I implement my coding knowledge to something I can see. I spend
                                a tremendous amount of time doing researches about web development, therefore, 
                                I barely see the existence of holidays.

                                With the knowledge of HTML and CSS it becomes much more easier to even do google
                                searches when I struggle to find certain functionality on MS Word.

                                When I got enrolled for a c# beginner course in 2019, I felt the need of learning web development just
                                after the introduction. I started by just watchinsg YouTube videos about HTML and CSS. After 
                                watching the videos for a long time, I felt ready to start installing everything and begin writing my
                                own projects. Doing the installation was a serious challenge, but eventually managed. My first projects
                                was just google, copy, paste, test, change few lines and test. As time went on I was now able to memorize
                                the html tags and css styles functionaities.

                                I use to hear a lot about javascript when I watch HTML and CSS videos. At that time I use to think
                                that javascript is Java but I was absolutely wrong. What attracted me to javascript was hearing
                                about the interative features you can add on the web using it. I learnt how to use javascript in SoloLearn
                                and w3school.com websites. With enough practise I started learning javascript DOM to create interative 
                                HTML features such as button.

                                In my second year I had computer data structures and algorithms course as one of my major. While I was busy with this course
                                I accidentally found out about databases in a YouTube video. When I saw the thumbnail, seemingly it was something interesting
                                and a must to know to be successful with web development. At that time I had no idea nor undestand how databases work or get integrated 
                                with programming languages. But I decided to go along and install Microft SQL Server Management studio to starts practising SQL syntax.

                                When I was in my final year of study in 2021, I already had too much knowledge of front-end web development.
                                The only thing I needed was to start learning the Back-end side, fortunately I already had a c# programming course.
                                Therefore, after writing my last exam I jumped straight to Udemy and purchased Asp.net Core MVC course and started
                                learning immediately. With the help of the Microsoft Asp.net core documentation it became much more easier 
                                to learn the framework.

                    As an engineering student, I always had a pile of projects to complete 
                    with different groups, therefore, it was compulsory to follow a specific
                    project management style to be able to manage the work. The main challenge
                    with project management was the management itself, it was never easy to keep up
                    with the work schedule but we eventually managed.

                                The most valuable lesson I learnt in project management is the value of time.
                                At the beginning you might get tempted into thinking that you will have
                                enough time to complete the project and procrastinate. The only thing 
                                that procrastination does, is to make your work a pile that you will have to complete 
                                in less time under pressure. This will not only result to burn out but to complete failure 
                                of the project.
                            </p>
                            <p class="slide-element">
                                When working with groups, fairly distribution of the work is mandatory.
                                Failure to do so will result in mismanagement of the projet which will
                                lead to lagging in some portion of the project. This process can only 
                                be accomplished by choosing a strong group leader.

                                One of the prominent tool I learnt in project management is a Gantt Chart.
                                This tool makes it easier to manage your time and also track your progress.
                                Using it has help me in making sure that I complete all my projects on time.

                <p class="intro-paragraph">
                    I wrote a lot of reports in my final year. I always had atleast 1 reports 
                    every month to complete. Writing reports was the most irritating thing to do 
                    at the beginning, but I eventually taught myself to love them.

                                The most interesting reports I ever wrote were for my electronic modules.
                                We use to compare two or more eletronic devices that has the same functionaities, but manufactured by different companies.
                                The aim of these reports was to find the best perfoming device in the list. This 
                                was done by collecting enough data about the components of the devices and compare
                                them. For instance, we will compare two or more smartphones that are competing in the current year
                                to find the best option.

                            </p>

                                In physics we use to write logbooks first before finalizing the reports.
                                The logbooks were used for collection data in the labs, it had full 
                                explanation of how an experiment was conducted and all the oberved data.
                                The reports were a summary of what was in the logbooks. These reports used 
                                be interesting if you clearly undestand the theory behind the experiment you are conducting.

                                We also use to write report after completing a certain projects or workshop.
                                If it was a project, we would write about the challenges we faced while 
                                working on projects, and what should be done in future to improve the projects. 
                                As for workshops, we used to write a brief reports about our experience at the
                                workshop.

                The aim of this project was to build an Ecommerse website that only focuses on selling shoes.
                The projects uses Asp.net core MVC framework for server side programming. I only launched this 
                project once on azure for testing. The project worked well on the launch, the only thing that I had 
                to do was to adjust the responsiveness.

            <p class="intro-paragraph">
                This chatting app was specifically built for the clients to easy communicate with the vendor.
                When creating this app I used SignalR to send the  chat and Ajax to save them to a database. 
                The app save the chats just in case the vendor or clients accidentally
                disconnect, thus, the clients or vendor would not have to worry about retyping everything.
